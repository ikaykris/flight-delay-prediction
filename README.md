Predicting flight delays is a critical challenge for the aviation industry, as delays can have significant financial and operational consequences for airlines and passengers. This study aims to predict flight delays using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. We employed the "flights.csv" dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/predicting-flight-delays-tutorial/input?select=flights.csv), which contains US flight data from 2015, and pre-processed the data to include relevant features and create a binary target variable. The impact of sample size on model performance and the effects of hyperparameter tuning were explored. Our findings indicate that increasing the sample size improves model performance, and hyperparameter tuning can help balance the trade-off between bias and variance. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating the potential of machine learning models to predict flight delays, thereby helping airlines and airports make informed decisions and improve operational efficiency.
